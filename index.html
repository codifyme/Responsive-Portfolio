            <p>When people say 'responsive design'they mean making your website look good on any device be it a
                phone,
                tablet,
                lapyop or desktop. </p>
            <p>in the past,
                companies tried to use separate websites for mobile device you may recall having to use sites that
                had an "m."infront of the URL(m.facebook.com) However,
                this had adverse effect their SEO. </p>
            <p>These days,
                an estimated 70% of a website's traffic comes from mobile devices, and this number is on the
                rise. in addition,
                websites that aren't responsive risk losing ground with Google- the company announced that
                any website that doesnt adapt to mobile screens will lose points in it's search engine ranking.
